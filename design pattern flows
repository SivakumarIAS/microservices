LEVEL 1 – Advanced Business Logic (Must-Have)

These show real-world thinking, not tutorials.

1️⃣ Order State Machine

Instead of simple status updates:

States

CREATED → PAYMENT_PENDING → PAID → PACKED → SHIPPED → DELIVERED
                         ↘ CANCELLED / FAILED


Why interviewers like this

Shows workflow design

Idempotency handling

Rollback scenarios

💡 Implement using:

Enum + transition validation

Strategy pattern

2️⃣ Inventory Reservation & Release

Problem

Two users try to buy the last item.

Solution

Reserve inventory for X minutes

Release if payment fails

Concepts

Optimistic locking

Version column in PostgreSQL

Scheduled cleanup job

3️⃣ Idempotent APIs

Prevent duplicate orders on retries.

Techniques

Idempotency-Key header

Store request hash

Reject duplicate execution

🔥 Very common interview question

⚙️ LEVEL 2 – Distributed Systems Concepts

This moves you into Senior Engineer territory.

4️⃣ Saga Pattern (Microservices Consistency)

Instead of DB transactions across services.

Example

Order created

Inventory reserved

Payment failed

Inventory rollback triggered

Implement

Choreography-based saga (events)

OR Orchestration (Order service as coordinator)

5️⃣ Event-Driven Communication

Replace sync REST calls with async events.

Events

OrderCreated

PaymentCompleted

InventoryReserved

OrderCancelled

Tech

Kafka / RabbitMQ (even basic setup is enough)

Why this matters

Loose coupling

Scalability

Fault tolerance

6️⃣ Retry, Timeout & Circuit Breaker

Simulate real failures.

Tools

Resilience4j

Timeout configs

Fallback responses

Scenario

Inventory service down → Order service degrades gracefully

🔐 LEVEL 3 – Security & Enterprise Features
7️⃣ Advanced Authentication & Authorization

Go beyond simple JWT.

Add

Refresh tokens

Token revocation

Role + permission-based access

API Gateway auth enforcement

8️⃣ Multi-Tenancy (B2B SaaS)

Each client has isolated data.

Models

Shared DB + tenant_id

OR schema-per-tenant

🔥 Very common in enterprise interviews

📊 LEVEL 4 – Performance & Observability
9️⃣ Caching Strategy

Use caching intelligently.

Cache

Product catalog

Inventory availability

User sessions

Explain

Cache eviction

Cache consistency issues

🔟 Distributed Logging & Tracing

Show you understand production debugging.

Add

Correlation IDs

Centralized logs

Trace order flow across services

1️⃣1️⃣ Metrics & Health Monitoring

Expose operational data.

Metrics

Order success rate

Payment failures

Inventory errors

🐳 LEVEL 5 – DevOps & Deployment Readiness
1️⃣2️⃣ Docker Compose + Profiles

Dev vs Prod configs

Environment variables

Secrets management

1️⃣3️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline (Optional but Powerful)

Even a basic one helps.

Steps

Build

Run tests

Docker image creation

🧪 LEVEL 6 – Testing Strategy (Very Important)
1️⃣4️⃣ Testing Pyramid

Include

Unit tests

Integration tests

Contract tests between services

Why
Interviewers will ask:

“How do you test microservices?”

🧩 BONUS FEATURES (Pick 1–2)

🧠 How to Talk About This in Interviews

You should be able to answer:

“How do you handle partial failures?”

“How do you avoid overselling?”

“How does your system scale?”

“How do you debug production issues?”
